Purpose:

Input:

# Create class student 
    # MBTI 
        eg. MBTI = [E|I, S|N, T|F, J|P]
    # Name  String
    # Age   Integer
    # DOB   Date
    # Subjects chosen

# Create class Subject
    # Intelligence  ?
    # Interest      Float

# Create class Teacher
    

    Subtask Intelligence:
        Student takes a test in the Subject
        The test contains questions with a scale on the Bloom's Taxonomy

    Subtask Interest:
        Input the following:
            1. MBTI

            2. CEI-Curiousity and Exploration Inventory (via the Teacher) on a scale of 1-7
                # Depict the following parameters as a dictionary/array 
                # eg. CEI = [1: actively_seeks_i , 2: involvement, 3: new_opportunities, 4: not_into_new, 5: distraction, 6: consistent]
                1. actively seeks information                           [1-7]
                2. involvement                                          [1-7]
                3. new opportunities/information/people/resources       [1-7]
                4. (-ve) usually not into new things                    [1-7]
                5. interruptability / distraction                       [1-7]
                6. consistent in looking for new things / experiences   [1-7]
                    
                    EXPLORATION = (CEI[1]+CEI[3]+CEI[4])        [18.74 <= EXPLORATION_AVG <= 19.97]
                    ABSORPTION = (CEI[2]+CEI[5]+CEI[6]+CEI[7])  [13.16 <=  ABSORPTION_AVG <= 15.44]
                    CURIOUSITY_AVG = (EXPLORATION_AVG + ABSORPTION_AVG) [32.70 <= CURIOUSITY_AVG <= 34.18]
